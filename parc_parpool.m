function parc_parpool(poolsize)
% Start parpool in different cases for parallel computing. 
% 
% The poolsize is a positive integer whose upper limit is constrainted by 
% several factors. Check:
%   1) Running Code on Parallel Pools - MATLAB & Simulink - MathWorks China
%   http://t.cn/Rq5rP8P
%   2) Memory. Reduce the pool size in case of the out of memory problem. 
% 
% The function 'matlabpool' is replaced by 'parpool' in R2013b (8.2) and
% removed in R2016a (9.0). See:
% Release Notes for Parallel Computing Toolbox - MATLAB & Simulink - 
% MathWorks China http://t.cn/Rq5eJ6q
% MATLAB version - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://t.cn/Rq5gI7R
% 
% This function is compatible with both 'matlabpool' and 'parpool', but the
% latter one is more suggested.
