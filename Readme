SLIC: a whole brain parcellation toolbox
Copyright (C) 2016 Jing Wang

This toolbox utilizes five whole brain parcellation approaches that 
operates on resting-state fMRI data to generate groupwise whole brain 
atlases. Three of the five approaches are reproduced from the Ncut-based 
approaches in (Craddock et al., 2012, HBM) and (Shen et al., 2013, 
Neuroimage). The remaining two are the mean SLIC and two-level SLIC 
approaches that integrate Ncut and SLIC. We used 190 subjects from the 
Beijing_Zang dataset to generate the atlases. And the resultant atlases 
are shared within this toolbox. For further information, see the 
Readme_data and Readme_plus files.
