SLIC: a whole brain parcellation toolbox
Copyright (C) 2016 Jing Wang

The SLIC toolbox contains five whole brain parcellation approaches that 
operates on resting-state fMRI data. Three of them are reproduced from the 
Ncut-based approaches in (Craddock et al., 2012, HBM) and (Shen et al., 
2013, Neuroimage). The remaining two are the mean SLIC and two-level SLIC 
approaches that integrate Ncut and SLIC. For further information, see the 
Readme_data and Readme_plus file.
