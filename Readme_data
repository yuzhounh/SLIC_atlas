SLIC: a whole brain parcellation toolbox
Copyright (C) 2016 Jing Wang

We used the Beijing_Zang dataset to generate the atlases in this toolbox. 

1. The rest.nii.gz of sub62966 seems to be acquired in a different 
orientation. (Note from the Beijing_Zang dataset.)

2. Subjects sub26713, sub49782, sub66889, sub82714 and sub85818 were 
excluded from the group analyses in the paper. An error occurred during 
the regression of the nuisance covariates. (Note from the Beijing_Zang 
dataset.)

3. The following subjects have empty time courses within the graymatter 
mask. Two of them, i.e., sub21115 and sub12220 were excluded since the 
number of empty time courses are large. 
sub52044, 1
sub21115, 43
sub12220, 28
sub71693, 5
sub67844, 1

Including the subjects in points 1 & 2, there were totally 8 subjects being 
excluede from analysis. Therefore, we calcuated the parcellation based on 
190 (of 198) subjects from the Beijing_Zang dataset. The preprocessed 
dataset is not shared since it is a huge data. You might use your own 
preprocessed fMRI data to generate the atlases, or you could just use the 
data of 40 subjects. 

For other information, please refer to the Readme_plus file, which was 
written for the demo. The major differences between the demo and this 
atlas generation toolbox are:
(1) There are 40 subjects being calculated in the demo while there are 190 
subjects being calculated in this toolbox. 
(2) Different evaluation metrics are computed in the demo but not in this
toolbox.
